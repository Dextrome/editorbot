# Data Directory

This directory contains sample audio files and training data for the AI Audio Editor.

## Structure

- `samples/` - Sample audio files for testing
- `training/` - Training data for ML models (not included in repo)

## Adding Sample Files

Place your test audio files (`.wav`, `.mp3`, `.flac`) in the `samples/` directory.

These files are ignored by git by default (except for small sample `.wav` files).
